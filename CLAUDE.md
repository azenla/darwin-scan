# DarwinScan — Claude orientation

A macOS app that catalogues everything interesting in the **system image** —
NOT user data. Default roots: `/System` (excluding `/System/Volumes` but
including cryptexes), `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr` (excluding `/usr/local`).

Stores results in a `.darwinscan` directory package so multiple scans can be
diffed by SHA-256.

## Build

```sh
# App
xcodebuild -project DarwinScan.xcodeproj -scheme DarwinScan -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' build
# CLI
xcodebuild -project DarwinScan.xcodeproj -scheme darwin-scan -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

Open in Xcode and Cmd+R to run. Deployment target is macOS 26.5; Xcode 26+.
The top-level **Run** group in the project navigator surfaces the built
`DarwinScan.app` and `darwin-scan` binaries — Cmd+click to reveal in Finder.

## CLI

`darwin-scan` ships next to the app target as a separate scheme.

```sh
# Generate a scan bundle the GUI can open
darwin-scan generate LocalSystem.darwinscan

# Restrict scope, skip hashing for a fast structural scan
darwin-scan generate --roots /usr/bin --no-hash-files --no-index-man-pages out.darwinscan

# Every ScanOptions toggle is exposed; see --help.
darwin-scan generate --help
```

When run from `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` the framework is loaded via the
`@executable_path/` rpath; copy `DarwinScanCore.framework` alongside the
binary if you install it elsewhere.

## Project shape

Xcode 26's **file-system-synchronized groups** are in use — anything you drop
inside any of the source roots is automatically compiled. No need to touch
the pbxproj to add files. We split into three buildable targets plus three
test targets:

```
DarwinScan/                        # App target (SwiftUI)
├── DarwinScanApp.swift            # @main, DocumentGroup
├── ContentView.swift              # NavigationSplitView root
├── Document/ScanDocument.swift    # ReferenceFileDocument; everything else is in core
└── UI/                            # SidebarView, ItemListView, DetailView, ScanProgressView, WelcomeView

DarwinScanCore/                    # Framework — all non-UI logic. Both app and CLI link this.
├── Models/                        # ScanItem, ScanOptions, ScanProgress, SystemInfo
├── Document/                      # ScanPackage, ScanStore, BlobStore, Database
├── Scanning/                      # Scanner + per-domain Inspectors + FileWalker + StringsExtractor
├── Search/                        # SearchQuery (parser + evaluator)
├── Utilities/                     # Hash, ByteFormat, SystemInfoCollector
└── CommandLineRunner.swift        # Synchronous-style scan driver for the CLI

DarwinScanCommand/                 # CLI target (ArgumentParser)
└── DarwinScanCommand.swift        # `darwin-scan generate <output>.darwinscan`

DarwinScanCoreTests/               # Swift Testing — framework unit tests (no app dependency)
DarwinScanTests/                   # Swift Testing — app-level integration tests (hosted in DarwinScan.app)
DarwinScanUITests/                 # XCTest — XCUI smoke tests
```

Adding a file under any synchronized root puts it in the corresponding
target. The app and CLI both `import DarwinScanCore`; the framework is
macOS-only with `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = macosx` and inherits the project's
MainActor default actor isolation.

## Critical build settings (DO NOT casually change)

- `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO` — required to read `/System`, `/bin`, `/usr`.
  Re-enabling the sandbox will break the entire app.
- `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES` — kept on. We spawn `/usr/bin/strings` and
  `/usr/bin/csrutil`; those are Apple-signed so the hardened runtime is fine.
- `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` — *infectious*. Every file-scope
  `let`, free function, type, and extension defaults to `@MainActor`. **Any
  helper called from `ScanWorker` (background actor) must be explicitly
  `nonisolated`.** Search the codebase for `nonisolated` to see the pattern.
  This bit us during the initial build — full cascade of warnings cleaned up
  by marking the inspectors and their file-scope helpers `nonisolated`.

```

`ScanItem` is a single discriminated record (one row per discovered thing).
The `category` field picks which of `executable` / `application` / `mlModel` /
etc. is populated. Tags are free-form chips for the UI; `context` is the
human disambiguator (e.g. owning bundle's display name); `relationships`
holds outgoing graph edges.

### Throttling and parallelism

- **Concurrency:** TaskGroup keeps `activeCPUs - 1` inspector tasks in flight
  at any time. The FileWalker producer is pumped from the actor body (single
  consumer), child tasks each process one URL.
- **Batch flush:** worker accumulates `InspectResult`s and flushes to the
  MainActor `batchSink` every **250 ms** or **256 items**, whichever comes
  first. Each flush is one SwiftUI re-render rather than N.
- **Progress emit:** separate **150 ms** throttle on `ScanProgress` snapshots
  so the toolbar/footer stays responsive without spam.
- **Blob bytes never cross actor boundaries.** Worker writes the data to
  `~/Library/Caches/io.zenla.DarwinScan/session-<uuid>/` via `BlobWriter`,
  then sends just the ref strings to MainActor. Peak memory bounded by
  ~workerCount × one blob.

### ScanStore indexes

Three indexes are maintained incrementally inside `Document/ScanStore.swift`,
all updated in `addIndexes(for:)` / `removeIndexes(for:)` on every `upsert`:

| Index                       | Shape                            | Purpose                                                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `categoryCounts`            | `[ItemCategory: Int]`            | Sidebar badge counts in O(1) per render                         |
| `pathReferencedBy`          | `[String: [UUID]]`               | Inverse adjacency — "Referenced By" panel in O(1) instead of O(N×E) |
| `itemsByOwningBundle`       | `[String: [UUID]]`               | "Contents" panel for `.app` / `.framework` / `.kext` bundles    |

These are not persisted — they're rebuilt in `load()` when a document opens.
Cost is one pass over the manifest at open time, ~10 ms for a /System scan.

**Adding a new index:** edit `addIndexes(for:)` / `removeIndexes(for:)` in
lockstep, plus `reset()`. Don't try to keep an index sorted — sort at read
time (it's cheap and avoids `Array.insert` shifting on every upsert).

## Rich search

`Search/SearchQuery.swift` parses Console.app-style faceted queries:

```
arch:x86_64 app:"Time Machine" tag:cli       # AND across filters
foo arch:arm64                                # filters + free text
bundle:CoreFoundation                         # any kind of bundle
private:true lang:en                          # boolean + value filters
```

Tokenizer respects `"quoted strings"` so values can contain spaces. Unknown
`field:value` pairs fall through to free text (no silent zeroing out of
results). Field aliases are intentional (`arch` / `architecture` /
`abi`; `framework` / `fw`; `kext` / `extension`; `lang` / `language` /
`locale`; …).

Free text matches across `name`, `path`, `context`, `tags`,
`executable.usageLine`, `application.bundleIdentifier`, and
`launchService.label`. Lowercased once per call to keep the per-item cost
near-zero — every filter is a substring test on already-lowered fields.

**Wired into `ItemListView`** via `.searchable`. The list shows recognized
filters as pill chips above the table; the `?` toolbar button opens a help
popover (driven by `SearchHelp.entries`) listing every field and example.

**Adding a new filter:** extend `SearchQuery.Filter`, add a case to
`filter(field:value:)`, `displayLabel`, `systemImage`, and `evaluate`. If it
needs an index to be fast, add the index to `ScanStore`.

## Graph model

`ScanItem.relationships: [Relationship]` carries outgoing edges keyed by
`targetPath` (paths are stable across scans, UUIDs aren't):

| Kind             | Source                  | Target                         |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `linksDylib`     | Mach-O LC_LOAD_DYLIB    | linked library path/`@rpath/…` |
| `ownedByBundle`  | child of any `.app/.framework/.bundle/.kext/.mlpackage/.mlmodelc` | enclosing bundle path |
| `launchesProgram`| LaunchAgent / LaunchDaemon plist | program executable path |
| `sameBundle`     | reserved for future     |                                |

`DetailView` renders both outgoing relationships *and* incoming references
(scans `store.items` for anyone pointing at this item's path).

## `.darwinscan` bundle layout

```
MyScan.darwinscan/
├── data.db           # SQLite (schema v1): items + relationships + meta
└── blobs/
    └── <2-char prefix>/
        └── <ref>.bin # content-addressed payload (icon PNG, strings dump…)
```

(Bundle format version 3.)

The SQLite database has three tables:

| Table          | Shape                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `meta`         | `(key TEXT PK, value BLOB)` — schema_version, system_info JSON, options JSON, timestamps |
| `items`        | `(id TEXT PK, path UNIQUE, category, owning_bundle_path, payload BLOB)` — payload is the full ScanItem JSON; denormalised columns exist only to support `category` and `owning_bundle_path` indexes |
| `relationships`| `(source_id, kind, target_path, note, PRIMARY KEY (source_id, kind, target_path))` — indexed on both `source_id` and `target_path` |

WAL mode + `synchronous=NORMAL`. Writes are transactional: `ScanStore.ingest`
batches one transaction per ~250 ms flush. Reads only happen at document
open (`Database.allItems` populates the in-memory dictionary).

When a document is **open**, the live `data.db` lives in
`~/Library/Caches/io.zenla.DarwinScan/session-<uuid>/data.db` alongside the
blob shards. `ScanDocument.snapshot` calls `database.checkpoint()` (WAL →
main file) before `FileWrapper(url:)` streams the file into the saved
bundle. On open we copy `data.db` out of the bundle into a fresh session
cache dir and attach it — that way the saved bundle stays untouched while
the user works.

**Legacy v2 bundles** (with `items.json` + `metadata.json`) still open:
`ScanPackage.load` detects them, parses the JSON, seeds a fresh `data.db`
in the session cache, and prints `[ScanPackage] Migrated legacy v2 bundle
to SQLite`. The next save writes a v3 bundle — there's no roundtrip back.

`<ref>` is `<hint>-<sha256-hex>`, e.g. `icon-3a4f...`, `strings-9b21...`.
Sharding by 2-char prefix mirrors git's loose-object scheme.

## Default scan scope

Set in `Models/ScanOptions.swift`. Material that ships in an IPSW:

| Include             | Exclude                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/System`           | `/System/Volumes` (user data, mounts)         |
| `/bin`              | `/usr/local` (Homebrew etc.)                  |
| `/sbin`             | `/usr/spool`                                  |
| `/usr`              | `/private/var/folders`, `/private/tmp`        |

User-state paths (`/Users`, `/Applications`, `/Library`, `/Volumes`, `/opt`)
are never scanned. The UI surfaces this guarantee.

## Recipe — adding a new category

1. Add a case in `ItemCategory` (`Models/ScanItem.swift`) with `displayName`
   and `systemImageName`.
2. If the category has a structured payload, add a `struct FooInfo: Codable`
   in the same file and a corresponding optional on `ScanItem`.
3. Write `Scanning/FooInspector.swift`:

   ```swift
   nonisolated enum FooInspector {
       static func inspect(url: URL) -> FooInfo? { ... }
   }
   ```

4. In `Scanning/Scanner.swift`, the `ScanPipeline.classify(url:)` switch —
   add a dispatch arm. Order matters (richer inspectors before fall-through
   Mach-O detection). If the item should have graph edges or a custom
   `context`, update `populateContextAndRelationships` too.
5. Add a `private struct FooDetailView` in `UI/DetailView.swift` and wire it
   into `DetailContent.body`.

If the inspector touches AppKit drawing APIs (NSGraphicsContext, image
drawing), it needs to be thread-safe — see `AppBundleInspector`/
`IconInspector` for the pattern (TIFF round-trip or `CGImageSource`
thumbnail).

## Recipe — adding a new field to an existing payload

Just add the field with a sensible default (`var newField: T? = nil`). Old
`.darwinscan` bundles continue to decode because JSONDecoder tolerates
missing keys when the property has a default.

## Mach-O parsing

`Scanning/MachOInspector.swift` parses headers directly via `FileHandle`
without importing `<mach-o/loader.h>` (their C structs aren't `Sendable`).
The constants are defined inline. Reads the first 256 KB — covers headers +
load commands for all reasonable binaries.

FAT binaries: parses the fat header, then descends into the first slice for
load-command data. The extra arch names are recorded for the architecture
list but not re-parsed (load commands repeat).

## Concurrency

- `ScanStore`, `ScanDocument`, `ScanController`, `BlobStore` are
  `@MainActor`-isolated.
- `ScanWorker` is an `actor` with its own isolation domain.
- `ScanPipeline` is a `nonisolated struct: Sendable` — child tasks of the
  worker's TaskGroup execute its methods directly, without any actor hops.
- `BlobWriter` is `nonisolated struct: Sendable` and just carries a directory
  URL. Concurrent writes to distinct files are safe on APFS.
- Inspectors and `FileWalker` are `nonisolated` so the pipeline can call
  them synchronously.
- Progress and batch ingestion cross actor boundaries via
  `@Sendable @MainActor` closures (`progressSink`, `batchSink`,
  `systemInfoSink`).

If you see a "main actor-isolated X in a synchronous nonisolated context"
warning when adding a helper, the fix is almost always: add `nonisolated`
to the declaration (type, extension, or `let`).

## Storage decisions

- **JSON for the manifest** because it's diff-friendly, human-inspectable, and
  fine up to tens of thousands of items. SQLite would scale further but adds
  complexity; defer it until a real scan blows past JSON's comfort zone.
- **Content-addressed blobs** so identical icons across 50 apps occupy one
  blob. Hashing twice is cheaper than storing duplicates.
- **`sha256` field on every ScanItem** so cross-scan diff is a simple set
  comparison.

## SQLite design notes

The manifest is SQLite (see schema above). The store keeps an in-memory
`[UUID: ScanItem]` dictionary as the source of truth at runtime — every
`upsert` and `ingest` mirrors into SQLite via `Database.upsertItem(s)`,
and `reset()` mirrors into `clearItems`. We did NOT remove the in-memory
dictionary: this migration was about persistence (incremental writes
during scan, no full-manifest JSON rewrite on save, no crash-loss risk)
rather than memory reduction. A future change can flip this around
(SQLite as primary, in-memory as a working set) once we want lazy
loading; the `Database` API already supports it.

Why ScanItem stays a JSON blob in the `items.payload` column rather than
denormalised columns: the model has 11+ optional discriminated payload
structs and would balloon the schema. Hot query paths (`item(atPath:)`,
`items(in:)`, `contents(ofBundleAtPath:)`) all hit dedicated columns +
indexes. The `payload` column is only read in bulk on document open.

Why content-addressed blobs stay as files outside SQLite: a single
strings-dump blob can be 50+ MB, and SQLite BLOBs aren't great at that
size. Files in `blobs/<2-prefix>/<ref>.bin` are also straightforward to
diff between bundles with `git diff` or `diff -r`.

**Sendable / actor isolation gotcha:** the project's
`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` means all model types
(`ScanItem`, `ScanOptions`, `SystemInfo`, every `*Info` struct) are
implicitly `@MainActor`, **including their `Codable` conformances**. The
nonisolated `Database` couldn't use those conformances. Every model
type is therefore explicitly `nonisolated` — if you add a new payload
struct, mark it `nonisolated` too or you'll get "main actor-isolated
conformance of X to Decodable cannot be used in nonisolated context".

## Known follow-ups (not yet built)

- Code signature parsing for team identifier extraction (we detect
  `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` but don't parse the blob).
- DYLD shared cache *image enumeration* (we parse the header but not the
  image list — needs more dyld_cache_format.h ported in).
- Cross-scan diff UI — the schema supports it but no command/view exists yet.
- Asset catalog (`Assets.car`) extraction.
- Full strings-cache search UI (the blob is stored when extracted, but no
  global search across blobs yet).
- Token-pill UI for search (`.searchable(text:tokens:)`) so typed filters
  become removable chips inside the search field instead of below it.
- Lazy loading on top of SQLite (in-memory as a bounded working set; full
  payloads fetched from `data.db` on demand). The Database API and bundle
  format are already in place — only ScanStore would need to change.

## Testing

Three test targets cover the stack:

| Target | Framework | Hosted in | What it covers |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `DarwinScanCoreTests` | Swift Testing | Framework-only | Search parser/evaluator, ScanItem Codable round-trip, ItemHeader projection, Database upsert/load/meta, ScanStore indexes, ScanPackage save/load, every inspector (PlistInspector, MachOInspector, DyldCacheInspector, LocalizationInspector, ManPageInspector, StringsExtractor), FileWalker excludes, CommandLineRunner smoke. |
| `DarwinScanTests` | Swift Testing | `DarwinScan.app` | UTType registration, SidebarSelection equality/hashing, ScanDocument lifecycle (init / snapshot / round-trip to disk), ScanController startScan + cancel against /bin, view-construction smoke. |
| `DarwinScanUITests` | XCTest / XCUI | App runner | Welcome view, sidebar category labels, toolbar Scan button, the New Scan options sheet. Deliberately does NOT trigger a real /System scan. |

Run everything from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project DarwinScan.xcodeproj -scheme DarwinScan -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

…or a single target:

```sh
xcodebuild -project DarwinScan.xcodeproj -scheme DarwinScan -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:DarwinScanCoreTests test
```

### Conventions

- New core logic → `DarwinScanCore/`, paired with a test in
  `DarwinScanCoreTests/`. Suites that touch `@MainActor` types use
  `@MainActor @Suite(..., .serialized)` to avoid parallel xctest
  isolation crashes.
- App-side glue → `DarwinScan/`, paired with a test in `DarwinScanTests/`.
  `@testable import DarwinScan` reaches `ScanDocument` (internal).
- New user-visible UI → add a smoke assertion to `DarwinScanUITests/`.
  Prefer the resilient predicate-based query (see
  `testSidebarListsCategoryLabels` for an example) over strict
  `app.staticTexts[...]` lookups — SwiftUI's accessibility-element
  type mapping drifts between SDK versions.
- Tests must NOT depend on the user's `/System` or anything outside the
  temp dir / `/bin`. The slowest sanctioned scan target is `/bin`
  (~37 binaries, sub-second).

### Path-canonicalisation note

The macOS temp dir lives under `/var/folders/...` and `/var` is a symlink
to `/private/var`. Foundation's `URL.path`, `URL.resolvingSymlinksInPath`,
and `NSString.resolvingSymlinksInPath` disagree about which form to
return. If a test compares paths produced by both `FileManager` and
`URL.appendingPathComponent` it'll trip over this. Prefer asserting on
counts or on substring containment over exact equality, or test the pure
predicate (`FileWalker.isExcluded`) directly.
